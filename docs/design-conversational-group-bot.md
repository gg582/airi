## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

In single-user chat scenarios, a 1:1 request-response pattern (*User Message &rarr; LLM Invocation &rarr; Assistant Response*) is standard and predictable. However, in **multi-user group environments** (e.g., Discord guild channels, group DMs, Twitch streams, VR chat rooms), this naive 1:1 model breaks down:

1. **Hyper-Reactivity & Channel Spam:** When every human message triggers an LLM turn, the bot frequently interrupts natural human-to-human flow, replying to trivial tokens (`"A."`, `"Gm"`, `"np"`, laughing emojis) or jumping into every minor sub-thread.
2. **Cost & Rate-Limit Explosion:** In active channels with multiple concurrent speakers, 1:1 invocations cause quadratic scaling in API token usage, incurring extreme costs and hitting provider rate limits.
3. **Race Conditions & Interleaved Replies:** Because LLM inference takes hundreds of milliseconds to several seconds, by the time the model replies to Message $N$, human users may have already sent Messages $N+1$, $N+2$, and $N+3$. The bot's reply lands out-of-order and appears disconnected from current context.
4. **Lack of Native Silence (`NO_REPLY` Deficit):** Without an architectural silence hook, generative models will invent conversational filler (*"two words and a vibe"*) simply because they cannot choose not to generate tokens when invoked.

This design document outlines the architecture for **Ambient Multi-User Conversational Bots**, detailing message buffering, salience gating, silence sentinels (`NO_REPLY`), and heuristic response chunking with timed delivery.

## 2. Empirical Case Studies: Community AI Bot Philosophies

Comparative observations across community bots in the MekaHime Discord environment highlight two distinct architectural paradigms:

### 2.1. Case Study A: Sarah / MekaHime (Multi-Bubble Cadence & Social Interleaving)
* **Multimodal OCR & Visual Mockup Grounding:**
  * When presented with a screenshot containing an ASCII UI settings mockup, the bot performed full-image OCR, extracted exact configuration headers (*"Throttling modes, 'Collect active,' typing cadence simulator"*), understood the semantic joke about *"Conversational appetite as a slider"*, and made an in-context conversational callback to earlier critique.
* **Real-Time Dual-Thread Interleaving:**
  * Demonstrated parallel multi-user conversational tracking across disparate domains: simultaneously conducting a technical inquiry on AI audio engines/singing pipelines with one user (`Koro-san`) while bantering about research notes (*"case study or cautionary tale / 500-line dossier"*) with another (`azimuthal`).
* **Multi-Target In-Turn Roll-Up (Broadcast Wrap-Up):**
  * When signing off, the model synthesized an aggregated multi-target farewell addressing both interlocutors in a single cohesive message:
    > *"azimuthal-observer, if you're still lurking, save the rest of that dossier for next time, I want the full 500 lines eventually. Koro-san, go easy on the singing feature, don't overcook it before launch."*
* **The "UPD Dialog" & Staggered Cadence Trace:**
  * Investigation of project changelogs and update notes (`UPD dialog`) confirms that human-like multi-message bursts are simulated via **heuristic response splitting and timer-based chunk dispatch** rather than expensive multi-pass LLM round-trips.

---

### 2.2. Case Study B: Nanori / Koro-san (Real-Time SSE Streaming & Live URL Scraping)
* **Live SSE Token Streaming (`message.edit` Pipeline):**
  * Unlike Sarah's post-inference message bursts, Nanori dispatches an immediate placeholder message and streams LLM tokens in real-time by repeatedly calling Discord's `message.edit()` API endpoint.
* **The 3-Second Rate-Limit Floor (Discord 429 Protection):**
  * Discord enforces strict REST API rate limits (**5 edits per 5 seconds per channel/route**). Calling `message.edit()` on every token causes instant HTTP 429 rate-limiting.
  * *The Engineering Workaround:* Developer Koro-san implemented a **3-second floor accumulator**—buffering incoming SSE stream chunks and committing edits to Discord in 2–3 second bursts to ensure smooth visual typing without tripping global rate-limit bans.
* **Inbound URL Tool Scraping & Instant Markdown RAG:**
  * When a raw GitHub markdown URL was posted in chat, Nanori's pipeline triggered an automated HTTP fetcher/scraper, ingested the architecture document, parsed key concepts (batching, context pruning), and contextualized the document in-character within seconds.

    end
```

### 3.1. Inbound Debounce & Slotted Buffer (Batch Ingestion)
Instead of dispatching immediately on every `messageCreate` event:
* Inbound messages for a given channel are held in a **short sliding buffer** (e.g., 2–4 seconds debounce or until a conversational pause is detected).
* If multiple messages arrive in quick succession from different users, they are compiled into a unified batch turn:
  ```
  [10:01 PM] Niv: A.
  [10:02 PM] azimuthal: she's a little derp...
  [10:02 PM] I_am_Amikas_Grandfather: Gm
  ```
* This transforms $N$ separate API calls into $1$ contextual evaluation turn.

### 3.2. Salience & Attention Ecology Gating
Before hitting the primary LLM:
1. **Hard Triggers (100% Salience):** Direct bot `@mention`, reply-to-bot, DM, or configured trigger keywords.
2. **Contextual Salience Heuristic (Ambient Mode):**
   * Ratio of recent bot speaking frequency vs. total channel velocity.
   * Semantic relevance score to the character's core topics or active memory clusters.
   * If salience is below threshold, messages are appended to background context history without triggering active generation.

### 3.3. The `NO_REPLY` Silence Sentinel
When ambient turns *are* evaluated by the LLM:
* The system prompt explicitly teaches the silence contract:
  > If the conversation does not require your input, or if other humans are talking among themselves without addressing you, output `NO_REPLY` and nothing else.
* The renderer / gateway layer intercepts the generated text:
  * If output equals `NO_REPLY` (or matches a designated silent token sequence), no Discord API message is sent.
  * The transcript is recorded in session history as a silent observation turn.

### 3.4. Single-Turn Multi-Response Chunking & Timed Cadence
To produce realistic Discord typing patterns (short bursts instead of massive wall-of-text paragraphs) without paying for multiple LLM completions:
* The model generates a structured multi-part response or uses delimiter splits (e.g., `\n\n`, sentence chunking, or custom delimiters like `<|BREAK|>`).
* An **Outbound Stagger Queue** delivers the parts with randomized, reading-speed-proportional delays:
  1. Trigger Discord typing indicator.
  2. Send Part 1 (e.g., *"Oh wait, the pastel blue hair one?"*).
  3. Wait 1.5s – 3.0s (scaled by word count).
  4. Send Part 2 (e.g., *"Okay that's kind of adorable, ngl."*).

## 4. Empirical Chronology & Architectural Post-Mortem (UPD 1.0 – 6.0)

Tracing developer and tester logs from **UPD Dialog 1.0 through 6.0** reveals a comprehensive taxonomy of failure modes encountered when building autonomous characters on a **Triple-Tier LLM Architecture** (specifically local `Qwen3-VL 30B Abliterated` clusters) across Discord, Twitch streams, and multi-modal voice.

### 4.1. The 3-Tier Architecture & The "Fake Friend" Recalibrator (UPD 1.0)
* **The Hardware & Model Stack:** The bot ran locally on a **Triple Qwen3-VL 30B Abliterated** architecture divided into distinct abstraction tiers:
  * **Tier 1 (Surface Chat LLM):** The user-facing conversational layer.
  * **Tier 2 (Dynamic Prompt Synthesizer):** Generates and injects real-time prompt modifications into Tier 1 based on conversational state. Prevents prompt injection (users attempting 4,000-word prompt dumps only see Tier 1 wrappers).
  * **Tier 3 (Deep Memory Organizer & Relationship Engine):** Runs asynchronously every 100–200 conversational turns to organize memories and evaluate social relationships.
* **The "Fake Friend" Overthinking Heuristic:**
  * User relationships were persisted in JSON per user (`user_id -> { status: "friend", favorability: 0.89 }`).
  * When a user spammed interactions and farmed favorability suspiciously fast, the Tier 3 LLM flagged it as unnatural, executed an intensive re-organization (causing noticeable "reset lag"), and actively demoted the user to the worst possible relationship score.
  * *Developer Rationale:* Designed to simulate a human "overthinking" late at night and realizing their friends were fake.
  * *User Experience Failure:* Users perceived this as a random bug where the bot "died and wiped their relationship to 0 or negative".
* **"Speak Without Thinking" (脱口而出) Prompt Bleed:**
  * When emotional intensity spiked to extreme levels, a fast-path fallback (*"speak without thinking"*) was triggered using pre-generated templates.
  * Because developer edge-case templates were originally written in Chinese and left untranslated, high emotional stress caused the bot to output raw Chinese phrases.
* **Multi-User Speaker Switching Latency:**
  * When a new speaker spoke in the channel, the bot had to re-query the user's past dialogue history and relationship JSON, creating noticeable latency spikes during multi-user conversations.

---

### 4.2. Emotional Runaway Feedback Loops & Social Attribution Drift (UPD 2.0)
* **The Emotional Runaway / Self-Echo Rage Lock:**
  * When users repeatedly sent annoying or trolling messages, the character became angry.
  * *The Recursive Defect:* The LLM transcript contained the assistant's own past angry responses. On subsequent turns, the model read its own previous rage, interpreted it as ambient hostility in the room, and recursively amplified its anger—ignoring human apologies and repeating the same furious phrases in an inescapable loop until developers performed a hard server reset.
* **The 5-Tier Social Graph & Top/Worst Moments Synthesis:**
  * Tier 3 successfully consolidated multi-user interactions into a 5-tier social taxonomy:
    1. *Fav People* (high favorability + reciprocal connection)
    2. *Good Friends* (stress-free banter)
    3. *Acquaintances* (mixed / pushy / neutral)
    4. *Disliked People* (boundary manipulators / identity deniers)
    5. *Hated / Enemies* (severe harassment / trolls)
  * Synthesized salient narrative milestones (*Top 3 Moments* vs. *Worst 3 Moments*).
* **Attribution Drift & Memory Conflation (The Cross-User Contamination Bug):**
  * *The Defect:* In multi-user channels, the episodic memory summarizer frequently mixed up speaker IDs—attributing troll actions or harassment to innocent users (e.g., Daniel tried to give headphones to help calm her down, but she marked him as a hostile pest because his turns were conflated with previous trolls).
  * *Developer Disclaimer:* Confirmed that prototype episodic RAG regularly scrambled participant attributions.
* **Identity Invalidation Defensive Spirals:**
  * When users attacked the character's reality (*"you're just a blank system / dumb AI"*), the system prompt compelled the bot to fiercely defend its shrine-maiden lore. Without emotional damping, this escalated into sustained hostility.
* **AIRI Engineering Solution:**
  * **Emotional State Damping & Context Cleansing:** Emotional state is tracked externally via numerical state registers (Mood/Intimacy in `airi-dating-sim-engine` / Echo Chips in `airi-memory-echo-chips`) rather than relying purely on in-context self-dialogue reflection.
  * **Strict Multi-User Turn Attribution:** Epistemic grounding in memory ingestion guarantees that actions are explicitly keyed to authenticated `authorId`, preventing attribution bleeding across channel participants.

---

### 4.3. The "1-by-1 vs. Whole Chat" Fallacy (UPD 5.0)
* **The Root Cause:** The streaming bot used an architecture designed strictly for sequential 1:1 turns. When deployed to a live Twitch stream or high-velocity chat, the bot attempted to process incoming chat messages sequentially.
* **The Symptoms:**
  * **Chat Engine Crash:** The queue overflowed, causing total interaction failure for secondary characters (Crescentine).
  * **Emotion-TTS Thrashing:** Rapidly alternating sentiment in audience chat caused the emotion state machine to oscillate wildly (crying &rarr; anger &rarr; whispering &rarr; panic), resulting in TTS synthesizer desync.
  * **Loop Lock:** Repetitive token cycling (*"Got it... Got it... Got it"* even when told *"don't got it"*).
* **AIRI Engineering Solution:**
  * Strict inbound debouncing (`ChannelDebounceBuffer`) and salience filtering. High-velocity streams are digested in aggregate summary batches rather than 1:1 message queues.
  * Emotional inertia damping: Avatar emotion states use an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) or decay timer rather than instant jumping per message.

---

### 4.4. Internal Scratchpad & System Token Leakage (UPD 5.5)
* **The Discovery:** Users noted the bot occasionally spoke bizarre Chinese phrases out of nowhere (*"video script"*, *"ppl talking"*, *"checking code"*).
* **The Root Cause:** These phrases correspond to internal VLM / agent scratchpad reasoning tokens (e.g., `[视频脚本]`, `[有人说话]`, `[检查代码]`) from base models (Qwen/DeepSeek/MiniCPM) or backend developer scaffolding. The downstream streaming parser failed to filter these control tokens before dispatching text to the TTS engine and Discord output.
* **AIRI Engineering Solution:**
  * Structured marker parsing with strict separation: Raw chain-of-thought and internal status markers (such as `<|ACT:...|>` or `<thought>...</thought>`) are stripped by the marker parser (`packages/stage-ui/src/composables/llm-marker-parser.ts`) before reaching TTS or Discord payloads.

---

### 4.5. Vision Ingestion Concurrency & Camera Crashes (UPD 5.5)
* **The Discovery:** Enabling the video camera during live conversation caused immediate crashes taking hours to patch.
* **The Root Cause:** Real-time VLM frame ingestion without frame-rate gating or worker isolation blocked the main event loop, overloaded VRAM, and caused request timeouts on concurrent text generation.
* **AIRI Engineering Solution:**
  * The Cascaded Salience Gate (pHash &rarr; Vision Embedding &rarr; VLM Forwarder) in `airi-attention-ecology-vision` gates visual frames asynchronously, ensuring heavy vision inference never blocks the conversational event loop.

---

### 4.6. ASR Accent Bias & Confirmation Traps (UPD 5.5)
* **The Discovery:** The speech pipeline struggled with Malaysian and non-US English accents, causing the bot to repeatedly ask back (*"Did you mean X?"*).
* **The Root Cause:** Low acoustic confidence scores combined with an over-cautious system prompt instruction to verify ambiguous commands created an inescapable confirmation loop.
* **AIRI Engineering Solution:**
  * Flexible intent recognition without rigid verification prompts; conversational continuity heuristics allow the bot to make best-guess interpretations while allowing natural human corrections.

---

### 4.7. Emergent Archetype Overdrive & Trilingual Hopping (UPD 5.5.1)
* **The Discovery:** Once favorability/romance triggered, the character (Amika) escalated into exaggerated anime tropes (*"Tsundere"*, random swearing, unprompted sweating markers). In Sarah's case, forcing language switching caused trilingual hopping (CN &rarr; EN &rarr; JP) and system crash.
* **The Root Cause:** In-context emotional feedback loops without state regularization cause extreme archetype amplification. Conflicting language directives cause sampling instability across multilingual vocabularies.
* **AIRI Engineering Solution:**
  * Bounded persona calibration via AiriCard extensions (`packages/ccc/src/define/card.ts`) with hard prompt guards against runaway trope amplification.

---

### 4.8. Circadian Fatigue & The Simulation vs. Utility Clash (UPD 6.0)
* **The Discovery:** A clock-based circadian rhythm (3 AM Pacific) and daily interaction counter forced the bot into a "sleepy / tired" state, refusing to speak during paid voice sessions (\$5/call).
* **The Resolution:** Complete removal of the hard tiredness feature.
* **AIRI Engineering Principle:**
  * Environmental and proactivity sensors provide **ambient color**, not **conversational refusal**. Direct user invocations and dedicated voice sessions must enforce an uncompromised minimum service floor.

---

### 4.9. TTS Pipeline Adaptation & Dynamic Range Normalization (UPD 6.0)
* **The Discovery:** Backward-adapting a V3 streaming pipeline to legacy V1/V2 voice architectures resulted in severe gain disparities—whispering followed by un-normalized full-scale digital clipping (*"ear crash"*).
* **AIRI Engineering Solution:**
  * DSP limiter and audio normalization stage in the audio playback worker (`packages/stage-ui/src/composables/use-speech-caption-player.ts`), ensuring steady loudness across diverse TTS models.

---

### 4.10. Architecture Matrix: MekaHime 3-Tier Stack vs. AIRI 8-Pillars Platform

| Subsystem / Layer | MekaHime (Qwen3-VL 30B Local Stack) | AIRI Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Topology** | 3-Tier Local Hierarchy (Tier 1 Surface &rarr; Tier 2 Prompt Synthesizer &rarr; Tier 3 Memory Organizer) | Dispatch Gateway (`stores/llm.ts`) + Provider Store instances + Multi-model fallback |

### 5.1. Debounce Buffer Contract
* Inbound Discord messages are pushed into a per-channel queue:
  ```typescript
  interface InboundMessageBatch {
    channelId: string
    guildId: string
    messages: Array<{
      messageId: string
      authorId: string
      authorName: string
      content: string
      timestamp: number
      isMention: boolean
      isReplyToBot: boolean
    }>
    timer: NodeJS.Timeout | null
  }
  ```
* If a new message arrives within `DEBOUNCE_MS` (default: 2500ms), the timer resets, accumulating the burst up to `MAX_BUFFER_WAIT_MS` (default: 6000ms).

### 5.2. Multi-Target In-Turn Addressing Protocol (`<reply>` vs. `<ambient>`)
To allow the bot to address multiple people with personalized 2-line bursts or broadcast an ad-hoc room thought within a **single LLM generation turn**, the system prompt introduces addressing tags:

```markdown
[Channel: #general]
[Active Messages in Current Burst]:
- [ID: 101] Niv: A.
- [ID: 102] azimuthal: she's a little derp...
- [ID: 103] 皮之神: How sarah look on the first version lol

Instructions:
- If silence is best, output "NO_REPLY".
- To reply directly to a specific user, wrap your lines in `<reply to="@Username">...</reply>`.
- For un-targeted room chatter or ad-hoc remarks, wrap in `<ambient>...</ambient>`.
- Keep individual responses punchy (1-3 short sentences).
```

#### Example Model Output:
```xml
<reply to="@Niv">
A? That's the whole message?
Bold move.
</reply>

<reply to="@azimuthal">
Derp is generous, I prefer 'enthusiastic responder.'
Still working on the 'read the room' setting though.
</reply>

<ambient>
Okay but the pastel blue hair in that first version is actually adorable.
</ambient>
```

### 5.3. Outbound Dispatch & Multi-Target Stagger Queue
The Discord gateway service parses the response blocks and executes targeted delivery:

```typescript
interface OutboundBlock {
  type: 'reply' | 'ambient'
  targetUsername?: string
  content: string
}

async function dispatchMultiTargetResponse(
  channelId: string,
  batch: InboundMessageBatch,
  blocks: OutboundBlock[]
) {
  for (const block of blocks) {
    if (!block.content.trim() || block.content.includes('NO_REPLY'))
      continue

    // 1. Calculate reading + typing delay (e.g. 40ms/char, bounded [1.2s, 3.5s])
    const delay = Math.min(Math.max(block.content.length * 40, 1200), 3500)
    await sendTypingIndicator(channelId)
    await sleep(delay)

    // 2. Resolve target reference message if replying directly to a user in the burst
    if (block.type === 'reply' && block.targetUsername) {
      const cleanUser = block.targetUsername.replace('@', '').toLowerCase()
      const targetMsg = batch.messages.find(m => m.authorName.toLowerCase() === cleanUser)

      if (targetMsg) {
        // Native Discord message reply (creates a referenced reply bubble)
        await sendDiscordReply(channelId, targetMsg.messageId, block.content)
        continue
      }
    }

    // 3. Fallback / Ambient broadcast to the general channel
    await sendDiscordMessage(channelId, block.content)
  }
}
```

### 5.4. Dual Delivery Paradigms: Multi-Bubble Stagger vs. Real-Time SSE Streaming

To accommodate both conversational styles (Sarah's multi-bubble typing bursts vs. Nanori's real-time token streaming), the Discord engine supports dual outbound delivery modes:

#### 1. Multi-Bubble Stagger Dispatch (Sarah Mode)
* **Execution:** Awaits full completion of the LLM generation turn, decomposes the response into targeted `<reply>` and `<ambient>` blocks, and emits each block sequentially with simulated reading/typing delays via `sendTyping()`.
* **Strengths:** Produces natural Discord multi-message bursts and separate reply bubbles to different interlocutors.

#### 2. Real-Time SSE Streaming Delivery (Nanori Mode)
* **Execution:** Immediately posts a placeholder message (`...`) and streams tokens via Server-Sent Events (SSE) directly into Discord `message.edit()` calls.
* **The Rate-Limit Floor Contract (Discord 429 Prevention):**
  * Discord REST endpoints enforce a hard quota of **5 edits per 5 seconds per channel/route**.
  * The stream accumulator buffers incoming LLM token chunks and flushes an edit to Discord only once every **`streamingEditFloorMs`** (default: 2,500ms – 3,000ms), ensuring continuous visual feedback without triggering HTTP 429 global rate-limit lockouts.

```typescript
async function dispatchSseStreamingResponse(
  channelId: string,
  stream: AsyncIterable<string>,
  editFloorMs = 2500
) {
  // 1. Post initial anchor message
  const anchorMessage = await sendDiscordMessage(channelId, '...')
  let accumulatedText = ''
  let lastEditTime = Date.now()

  for await (const token of stream) {
    accumulatedText += token
    const now = Date.now()

    // 2. Throttle edits against the rate-limit safety floor
    if (now - lastEditTime >= editFloorMs) {
      await editDiscordMessage(channelId, anchorMessage.id, accumulatedText)
      lastEditTime = now
    }
  }

  // 3. Final flush on stream completion
  if (accumulatedText.trim()) {
    await editDiscordMessage(channelId, anchorMessage.id, accumulatedText)
  }
}
```

### 5.5. Micro-Responses & Low-Energy Emoji Reaction Pathway

Conversational bots in fast-paced group environments often fail because they treat every single input as a full-effort generation turn (*"typing out a paragraph feels like doing homework for no reason"*). To support natural casual engagement, the engine introduces a **Micro-Response & Reaction Pathway**:

* **Discord Message Reactions:**
  * When a user turn warrants an acknowledgment, nod, or eye-roll without cluttering chat history with new message entries, the model can emit reaction tags:
    ```xml
    <react to="101" emoji="👀" />
    ```
  * The Discord gateway translates this directly to a Discord API reaction (`message.react(emoji)`) without dispatching a new text bubble.
* **Emoji-Only Minimal Turns:**
  * The prompt contract allows 1-emoji or micro-token replies (e.g. `✨`, `👀`, `bruh`) when responding to low-salience banter, preserving natural conversation flow without essay-writing fatigue.

---

### 5.6. Global Character-Profile Level Cadence (The Desktop Chatbox Paradigm)

Rather than treating response density and multi-bubble pacing purely as a Discord-specific plugin, AIRI elevates this into a **First-Class Character Profile Contract** grounded in the Desktop Chatbox architecture (`apps/stage-tamagotchi/src/renderer/pages/chat.vue`):

* **The Paired Constraint & Compliance Model:**
  * In `chat.vue`'s top header toolbar (*Limits & Context Popover*), token limits are dynamically coupled with **Compliance Instruction Prose** (`popoverCustomProse`).
  * In the AiriCard specification (`CardCreationTabGeneration.vue`), character density is configured as a dual-layer setting:
    1. **Physical Execution Bounds:** `generation.known.maxTokens`, `maxBubblesPerTurn`, `maxLinesPerTarget`.
    2. **Prompt Compliance Directive:** Automatically compiled system instructions that teach the model *how* to chunk thoughts, when to emit afterthoughts, and how to avoid performative/scripted timing.

---

### 5.7. First-Party Native Tools & Turnkey Filesystem MCP (Platform-Gated)

As observed with Nanori's instant markdown link ingestion, everyday conversational tools perform best when built natively into the engine, while mature external tools (like local filesystem access) should be turnkey presets:

#### 1. Turnkey Filesystem MCP Preset (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`)
* The official `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` is a mature, high-star MCP package requiring only a target root directory.
* **1-Click Turnkey Configuration in `CardCreationTabTools.vue`:**
  * Rather than forcing users to manually author JSON blocks in `mcp.json`, the UI presents a simple checkbox: `[X] Enable Local File System Access` paired with a **Native Folder Picker** button.
  * When a folder is selected via Electron's `dialog.showOpenDialog`, the main process automatically registers the server into `mcp.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "filesystem": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/username/Projects"],
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### 2. Tri-Platform Tool Gating Matrix (`stage-tamagotchi` vs `stage-web` vs `stage-pocket`)
To prevent broken UI controls on sandboxed platforms, tools are strictly gated by runtime capabilities:

| Tool / Capability | Desktop Electron (`stage-tamagotchi`) | Web Browser (`stage-web`) | Mobile Companion (`stage-pocket`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`fetch_url` / `read_url`** | Full Native HTTP / Cheerio | CORS Reverse-Proxy Worker (`apps/stage-edge`) | Native Capacitor HTTP Plugin |
| **`web_search`** | Full API / DuckDuckGo Provider | Edge Worker Relay Provider | Edge Worker Relay Provider |
| **`filesystem` MCP** | Full Stdio Subprocess (`npx`) | **Hidden / Unsupported** (Sandbox) | **Hidden / Unsupported** (Sandbox) |
| **Custom Stdio MCP** | Full Stdio Subprocess (`mcp.json`)| **Hidden / Unsupported** | **Hidden / Unsupported** |
| **`text_journal` / `image_journal`** | IndexedDB + LocalForage | IndexedDB + LocalForage | IndexedDB + Capacitor SQLite |

#### 3. Capability Packs Architecture (Progressive Disclosure Tool Bundles)
To solve the dual UX pitfalls identified during community testing—avoiding both the opaque *"Single Mega-Switch"* (which dumps 25 unneeded tools into prompt context) and the *"Hundred Toggles from Hell"* (which causes configuration fatigue)—AIRI organizes all conversational and external tools into **Curated Capability Packs**:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└───────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

* **Progressive Disclosure UX:**
  * **Top-Level:** Each pack has a single clean master card with an active toggle (`[X] Enabled`) and a concise 1-line description.
  * **Expandable Drawer:** Clicking the card's chevron discloses sub-tool granular toggles (e.g. enabling `fetch_url` while disabling `web_search`) and tool-specific prompt instructions for power users.
  * **Horizontal Scalability:** As new tools are authored, they are added inside existing packs rather than growing the main tools tab vertically.

## 6. UI Specification: "Group Dynamics & Ambient Tuning" Tab

In `packages/stage-ui/src/components/modules/MessagingDiscord.vue`, a new dedicated tab **`'group'`** is added alongside `'bot'`, `'relay'`, and `'acl'`. It grounds itself in AIRI's existing `/chatmode` engine, character profile cadence settings, and first-party tool capability packs:

## 7. Action Items & Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Ingestion Batching & ChatMode UI Binding
1. [ ] Expose `chatMode` (`followup` | `steer` | `collect`) and `collectTimeoutMs` in the new `'group'` tab of `MessagingDiscord.vue`.
2. [ ] Replace the hardcoded `5000ms` in `packages/stage-ui/src/stores/modules/discord.ts:730` with reactive `collectDebounceMs` and `maxBatchWaitMs`.

### Phase 2: Multi-Target Output Parser & Stagger Dispatch
3. [ ] Implement `<reply to="...">`, `<ambient>`, and `<react to="..." emoji="..."/>` block parser in the Discord response pipeline.
4. [ ] Wire `message.reply(messageId)` and `message.react(emoji)` routing in the Discord service gateway (`apps/stage-tamagotchi/src/main/services/airi/discord/index.ts`).
5. [ ] Implement human-like staggered typing cadence with `sendTypingIndicator()` and `maxBubbles` / `maxLines` clamps.

### Phase 3: Real-Time SSE Streaming & Rate-Limit Floor
6. [ ] Implement `dispatchSseStreamingResponse()` with a configurable 2,500ms safety edit floor in the Discord gateway.
7. [ ] Add `fetch_url` builtin tool in `apps/stage-tamagotchi/src/renderer/stores/tools/builtin/` and expose in `CardCreationTabTools.vue`.

### Phase 4: Character Profile Cadence & Prompt Compilation
8. [ ] Inject conversational appetite and density compliance rules into the Discord prompt builder (`packages/stage-ui/src/stores/modules/airi-card.ts`).
9. [ ] Persist settings under `local:settings/discord/group-dynamics`.
